This skin contains very limited functionality and exists solely as
proof of concept.  It is based on the Grinnell Plans system
(www.math.grinnell.edu/~heckr/Finger/), although only parts are
implemented here (no preferences, autofinger, etc., although these
could be added using get/setPreference() and the planwatch code).  For
more information, please visit their website or email
plans@grinnell.edu.
