Planworld was initially developed at Amherst College during 2000-2001
by Alex Hochron ('02) and Seth Fitzsimmons ('02).  Design assistance
was provided by Peter Kupfer ('01) and Baker Franke ('02).  The finger
daemon was modified for use with planworld by James Flemer (RPI '02.5)
and Seth Fitzsimmons from "Fefe's finger daemon"
(www.fefe.de/ffingerd).  The theme system and XML-RPC backend was
developed by Seth Fitzsimmons.  Themes were provided by Baker Franke,
Lynne Baer ('00), Jonathan Kaldor ('03), Katie Buechner ('04), Lila
Maclean ('02), and Matt Gordon ('03).

Planworld is a web-based adaptation of VMS plan-use at Amherst
College.  Planwatch was originally developed on the VAX by John Manly
('85) and Jonathan Welch ('84).  Snitch was originally developed on
the VAX by Jonathan Welch in 1999.  Additional inspiration was drawn
from planwatch.org (Josh Davidson) and musings by Johnnie Odom ('00).
