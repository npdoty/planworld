In this directory you will find a perl script to convert cookie data
files (such as fortune.txt) into appropriate SQL statements for
insertion into the planworld cookie system (such as SQL/cookies.sql).
fortune.txt is taken from Amherst's VMS system; you can easily
substitute one of your own choosing and import that instead.
